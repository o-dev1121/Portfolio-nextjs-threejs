This was my first project using Vite. Initially made using tutorial of JavaScipt Mastery.

Work done on it other than the tutorial:-
- Removed unused CSS.
- Removed Extra Animations.
- Made UI Faster.
- Added a Resume Button (Where you can put a link to your resume).
- Enhanced Visibility and solved Responsive UI Problems.

This Project is hosted in Netlify : [3D Portfolio](https://osmel-trillo.netlify.app/)
